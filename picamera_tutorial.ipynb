The error occurs because the device to which the camera is attached currently only allocates a very limited amount of 64MB of contiguous memory blocks (cma). Each still capture requires a cma buffer amount that is proportional to the size of the target picture. Development efforts are currently ongoing to allow the allocation of more CMA on boot time to allow for larger frames."

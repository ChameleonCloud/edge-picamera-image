We currently are in the process of staffing several of our raspberrypi 4 devices with pi camera modules; later, this month of June 2024, an official blogpost on peripherals will accompany this artifact presenting a hollistic approach for users to add peripherals to CHI@Edge.\n",

The error occurs because the device to which the camera is attached currently only allocates a very limited amount of 64MB of contiguous memory blocks (cma). Each still capture requires a cma buffer amount that is proportional to the size of the target picture. Development efforts are currently ongoing to allow the allocation of more CMA on boot time to allow for larger frames."
